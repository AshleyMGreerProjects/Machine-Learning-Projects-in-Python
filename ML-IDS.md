**Project Name:** Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Python Script

**Author:** Ashley M. Greer, Jr

**Project Overview:**

This project involves the creation of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) leveraging Python to monitor and analyze network traffic. The IDS employs machine learning techniques, specifically the Isolation Forest algorithm, to detect anomalies and potential security threats in real-time. This script is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing network infrastructure, providing real-time alerts and comprehensive logging of events for further analysis.

**Features:**

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuously monitors network traffic to identify and log potential threats as they occur.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Utilizes the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect anomalies in network traffic data, providing a robust mechanism for identifying unusual patterns that may indicate security incidents.
- **Data Visualization:** Includes a module for visualizing event counts over time, making it easier to identify trends and patterns in network traffic.
- **Log Management:** Efficiently manages logs, storing them for future reference and analysis.
- **Model Retraining:** Supports model retraining to improve the accuracy of anomaly detection over time as new data becomes available.
- **Alert Generation:** Automatically generates alerts for detected anomalies, enabling prompt response to potential threats.

**Technologies Used:**

- **Python:** The core language used for implementing the IDS.
- **Scikit-Learn:** Used for the implementation of the Isolation Forest algorithm for anomaly detection.
- **Matplotlib:** Used for data visualization, allowing users to plot event counts over time.
- **Tkinter:** Provides a simple GUI interface for controlling the IDS and visualizing data.

**Usage:**

- **Start Monitoring:** Use the GUI to start the IDS, which will begin monitoring network traffic in real-time.
- **View Logs:** Access and review the logs generated by the IDS to analyze past events and detect potential security incidents.
- **Visualize Data:** Use the visualization tools to plot event counts over time, helping to identify patterns in network traffic.
- **Retrain Model:** As new data becomes available, retrain the anomaly detection model to improve accuracy.

**Future Enhancements:**

- **Integration with SIEM Tools:** Future versions may include integration with popular SIEM tools for a more comprehensive security management system.
- **Advanced Threat Detection Algorithms:** Consider implementing more advanced machine learning algorithms to enhance threat detection capabilities.
